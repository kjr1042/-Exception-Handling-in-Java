- **[Exception Propagation](#exception-propagation):** Explaining how exceptions propagate through the call stack.
- **[Best Practices](#best-practices):** Guidelines and best practices for effective exception handling in Java.

## Highlights

- **Try-Catch Blocks:** Explore real-world scenarios where try-catch blocks shine, gracefully managing exceptions without compromising code readability.

  ```java
  try {
      // Code that may throw exceptions
  } catch (ExceptionType1 ex1) {
      // Handle exception type 1
  } catch (ExceptionType2 ex2) {
      // Handle exception type 2
  } finally {
      // Optional: Cleanup code that runs regardless of exceptions
  }
